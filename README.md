# True Feedback

This full-stack project is a web application that allows users to send and receive anonymous messages. Users can create unique IDs or links to share with others, enabling them to receive anonymous feedback, compliments, or any form of communication without revealing the sender's identity. The platform ensures privacy and anonymity by not requiring user registration or personal information for sending anonymous messages. For receiving messages, registration is done with NextAuth which supports OTP based verification.
